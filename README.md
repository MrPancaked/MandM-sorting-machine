# M&M sorting machine
This was a school project when I was studying Applied Physics where I had to learn about actuators, sensors, and motors in CircuitPython using a [Featherboard M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857?srsltid=AfmBOop4Vjmj0NPMtcxiQowiWpqtWunyc-AtnrWgqPJN2NJAfQkOT8BI). 
Specific challenges included dealing with non-ideal real world scenarios like button bouncing and color measurement and servo angle inaccuracies, 
and of course, building a machine with structural integrity using waste items like cardboard.
